Moi-moi! Minun nimeni on Sergei

- Current occupations:
  - I'm currently conducting doctoral research in "inverse graphics" at CS, Aalto University. Dense image correspondence don't have to be as bad as you thought! Stay tuned
  - I lead computer vision development at [Spheroid Earth](http://www.spheroiduniverse.io)
  - I try to keep up with the state of [CUDA](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/CUDA) in
    [NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/), because Nix is arguably
    the best available tool for deploying machine learning and scientific
    computing software. Although I chat more than I do work: join us in
    [#cuda:nixos.org](https://matrix.to/#/#cuda:nixos.org)
- Update feeds:
  - I'm mostly present at [@nobody@mastodon.acm.org](https://mastodon.acm.org/@nobody)
  - I shit post on [twitter](https://twitter.com/SomeoneSerge)
  - I occasionally write on [NixOS Discourse](https://discourse.nixos.org/u/sergek/summary)
  - I used to blog at [https://someoneserge.github.io/](https://someoneserge.github.io/), but it's temporarily down
