Salut! I'm Serge. My main interests currently are around inverse graphics,
but I'm actually curious about anything-mathematics and anything-programming.

My [blog's](https://newkozlukov.gitlab.io) currently somewhat broken, but you
probably can see what I'm up to on my (temporarily existing)
[twitter](https://twitter.com/SomeoneSerge). _Mind you, twitter's still a
proprietary and un-ethical platform that restricts user's rights and
deliberately manipulates user's engagement by exploiting humans' behavioural
bugs._

- Some things I've been spending time on, recently:
    - Reproducible home environment with [Nix](https://nixos.org): https://github.com/newkozlukov/dotfiles
    - Playing around with Neural Radiance Fields (private yet): https://github.com/newkozlukov/nerfs
    - Camera localizatin and calibration, image retrieval (private yet)
    - Riemannian optimization (currently taking time off): https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt
